## CLI Functionality Verification ✅

### View Command Help
```bash
$ ./bin/ghp view --help
Manage views in GitHub Projects.

Views provide different perspectives on your project data, allowing you to 
organize and visualize items in ways that best suit your workflow. GitHub 
Projects supports multiple view types:

• Table views - Traditional table layout with customizable columns
• Board views - Kanban-style boards with swimlanes
• Roadmap views - Timeline-based planning views

This command group provides comprehensive view management capabilities:

• List existing views in projects
• Create new views with different layouts
• Update view names and filters
• Copy views to create variations
• Delete views when no longer needed
• Configure view sorting and grouping

View Layouts:
  table       - Table view with customizable columns
  board       - Kanban board view with card layout  
  roadmap     - Timeline roadmap for planning

View Operations:
  list        - List all views in a project
  create      - Create a new project view
  update      - Update view name or filter
  copy        - Create a copy of an existing view
  delete      - Delete a project view
  sort        - Configure view sorting options
  group       - Configure view grouping options

Available Commands:
  copy        Copy a project view
  create      Create a new project view
  delete      Delete a project view
  group       Configure view grouping
  list        List project views
  sort        Configure view sorting
  update      Update a project view
```

### Individual Command Verification
```bash
$ ./bin/ghp view create --help
Create a new view in a GitHub Project.

Views provide different ways to visualize and organize your project data.
You can create table, board, or roadmap views depending on your needs.

View Layouts:
  table       - Table view with customizable columns and sorting
  board       - Kanban board view with swimlanes and cards  
  roadmap     - Timeline roadmap for milestone planning

Examples:
  ghp view create octocat/123 "Sprint Dashboard" table
  ghp view create octocat/123 "Bug Board" board --filter "label:bug"
  ghp view create --org myorg/456 "Release Roadmap" roadmap
  ghp view create octocat/123 "High Priority" table --filter "priority:high" --format json

$ ./bin/ghp view sort --help
Configure sorting for a project view.

You can set the field to sort by and the sort direction. Use --clear to
remove sorting from the view.

Sort Directions:
  asc, ascending    - Sort in ascending order (A-Z, 1-9, oldest first)
  desc, descending  - Sort in descending order (Z-A, 9-1, newest first)

Examples:
  ghp view sort view-id --field priority-field-id --direction desc
  ghp view sort view-id --field status-field-id --direction asc
  ghp view sort view-id --clear
  ghp view sort view-id --field due-date-field-id --direction asc --format json
```
